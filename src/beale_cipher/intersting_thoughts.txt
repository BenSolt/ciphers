Robert Morriss, as represented in the pamphlet, says he was running the Washington Hotel in 1820. Yet contemporary records
show he did not start in that position until at least 1823.[19]


Existence of Thomas J. Beale
A survey of U.S. Census records in 1810 shows two persons named Thomas Beale, in Connecticut and New Hampshire.
However, the population schedules from the 1810 U.S. Census are completely missing for seven states, one territory,
the District of Columbia, and 18 of the counties of Virginia.[20] 
The 1820 U.S. Census has two persons named Thomas Beale,Captain Thomas Beale of the battle of New Orleans 1815 in Louisiana 
originally from Virginia Botetourt County â€“ Fincastle area 12 miles from Bedford County and

one in Tennessee, and a Thomas K. Beale in Virginia, but the population schedules are
completely missing for three states and one territory.Before 1850 the U.S.Census recorded the names of only the heads of 
households; others in the household were only counted. Beale, if he existed,may have been living in someone else's household.
[21]In addition, a man named "Thomas Beall" appears in the customer lists of St. Louis Post Department in 1820. According to
the pamphlet, Beale sent a letter from St. Louis in 1822.[18] 

Additionally, a Cheyenne legend exists about gold and silver 
being taken from the West and buried in mountains in the East, dating from roughly 1820.[18]

AUTHENTICITY
The letters also contain several English words, such as "improvise", not otherwise recorded before the 1820s in English,;[13] 
but used from French from 1786 in the New Orleans area[14] and stampede (Spanish) "an uproar".[15] Beale's "stampeding" apparently
first appears in print in the English Language in 1832[16] but was used from 1786-1823 in New Orleans in French and Spanish.[1]
