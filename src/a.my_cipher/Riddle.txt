BURIED TREASURE

A treasure buried is what you seek
Do you have the resolve for this challenge
Dresher Pennsylvania is where

To start, locate a place of New Life
Head in any direction you like
Radius no greater then four miles
Exasperated you may become
Even so dont give up hope  

The key is a document
Of importance, some may say

Everything you require is neigh
A piece of the cipher is within
Change is what is desired
Hidden messages become clear

Numbers cipher tells where its hidden
Understand that its not easy
Many will abandon this quest
But if you persevere
Excavate the buried treasure
Richer you will be if you solve thee
